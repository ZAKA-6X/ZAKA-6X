# ⚡ White Label Technical Partner for Boutique Agencies

### We protect your Senior Team's "Flow State" by handling your backlog asynchronously.

---

**Current Status:** ✅ Open for White Label Retainers (React / Node.js)

---

### 🎯 The Value Proposition
You run a high-performance agency. Your Senior Engineers cost you €600-€900+ per day. **Why are they fixing padding issues, updating API depreciations, or chasing minor bugs?**

I run a specialized micro-agency acting as a **White Label Technical Partner**. We clear the technical debt and "annoying" tickets that bloat your backlog, allowing your core team to focus on high-value architecture and feature delivery.

| ❌ The Problem | ✅ The 6X Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Context Switching:** Seniors lose hours ramping up/down for small fixes. | **Focus:** We handle the noise. Your team handles the signal. |
| **Backlog Bloat:** Small bugs erode client trust over time. | **Velocity:** We maintain a strictly asynchronous resolution loop. |
| **Hiring Friction:** Junior devs require management overhead. | **Plug & Play:** We integrate silently into your GitHub/Jira flows. |

### ⚙️ Operational Model: Asynchronous & White Label

We operate as a silent extension of your agency.

1.  **Ticket Assignment:** You tag us in GitHub Issues, Linear, or Jira.
2.  **Resolution:** We branch, fix, test, and open a PR adhering to *your* linting and coding standards.
3.  **Review:** Your lead reviews the code. We handle revisions immediately.
4.  **Zero Friction:** No Zoom calls. No "stand-ups." Just code delivery.

> **Note to CTOs:** We respect NDA and IP strictures. Our work is 100% white-label—your clients see *your* agency's excellence, backed by our execution.
